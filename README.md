Prova is a java-based modular keyword driven framework able to combine different kind of tests in a single test script.
The project was started in an attempt to create a user friendly frond-end for tests scripts for Oracle ATS that allows us to separate test flow and data and doesn't require programming skills or technical knowledge of a tool. 
Now it's a standalone framework able to read test from different sources and execute tests in different types of test tools.

# History
Prova version 1 was developed as an internal project. Version 2 will be developed as an open source project here on Github. We will start from scratch and only parts of the original code are re-used.
If you are interested in verion 1 please contact Robert Bralts and request a compiled version of version 1.

# Prova architecture

# Authors and Contributors
Prova started as an internal company project when no suitable tools were found for our needs. While developing the proof of concept other parties also showed interest in the project and we decided to release Prova for the public as an open source tool.
Prova was started by Sjoerd Boerhout (@sjoerdboerhout) & Robert Bralts (@bralts). Other contributors of the first version are Hielke de Haan (@hylkdh) and Coos van der GaliÃ«n (@coos88).
