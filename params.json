  "body": "## Welcome to Prova.\r\n\r\nProva is a java-based modular keyword driven framework able to combine different kind of tests in a single test case.\r\nWe started this project to develop a user friendly frond-end for tests that allows us to separate test flow and data and doesn't require any technical knowledge about a tool.   \r\n\r\n## Plugin structure\r\nAll input, output and reporting goes through plugins for maximum flexibility. Prova is the spider in the web that connects all the plugins and directs the data from input to output with a pre-defined set of actions keyword as connecting element. \r\n\r\n## Available input plugins\r\n- MS Excel (using Apache POI)\r\n\r\n## Available output plugins\r\n### WEB tests\r\n- Selenium: Test web pages with the well known Selenium web driver.\r\n\r\n### Shell commands\r\n- planned: Execute commands on the OS command line.\r\n\r\n### Database tests\r\n- planned: Validate db scheme's and execute queries.\r\n\r\n### SOAP tests\r\n- Under development: Send and receive SOAP messages.\r\n\r\n### JSON tests\r\n- planned: Send and receive JSON messages.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nProva started as an internal company project when no suitable tools were found for our needs. While developing the proof of concept  others also showed interest in the project and we decided to release Prova for the public as an open source tool.\r\nProva was started by Sjoerd Boerhout (@sjoerdboerhout) & Robert Bralts (@bralts). Other contributors of the first version are Hielke de Haan (@hylkdh) and Coos van der GaliÃ«n (@coos88).\r\n\r\n## License and usage\r\nWe decided to share Prova with the world not only to share a useful tool, but also with the hope that other will develop new modules for Prova.
