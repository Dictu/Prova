  "body": "## Welcome to Prova.\r\n\r\nProva is a java-based modular keyword driven framework able to combine different kind of tests in a single test case.\r\nThe project was started in an attempt to create a user friendly frond-end for tests scripts for Oracle ATS that allows us to separate test flow and data and doesn't require any technical knowledge about a tool. \r\n\r\n## Plugin structure\r\nAll input, output and reporting goes through plugins for maximum flexibility. Prova connects all the plugins and directs the data from input to output without exact knowledge about the test type and specific action. \r\n\r\n## Available input plugins\r\n- MS Excel (using Apache POI)\r\n\r\n## Available output plugins\r\n### WEB tests\r\n- Selenium: Test web pages with the well known Selenium web driver.\r\n\r\n### Shell commands\r\n- planned: Execute commands on the OS command line.\r\n\r\n### Database tests\r\n- planned: Validate db scheme's and execute queries.\r\n\r\n### SOAP tests\r\n- Under development: Send and receive SOAP messages.\r\n\r\n### JSON tests\r\n- planned: Send and receive JSON messages.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nProva started as an internal company project when no suitable tools were found for our needs. While developing the proof of concept other parties also showed interest in the project and we decided to release Prova for the public as an open source tool.\r\nProva was started by Sjoerd Boerhout (@sjoerdboerhout) & Robert Bralts (@bralts). Other contributors of the first version are Hielke de Haan (@hylkdh) and Coos van der GaliÃ«n (@coos88).\r\n\r\n## License and usage\r\nProva is licensed with the EU Public license. This means everyone is free to use Prova for their own purpose and to contribute to it's development with new plug-ins or features.",
